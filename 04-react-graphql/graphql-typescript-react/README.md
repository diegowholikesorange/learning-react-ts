Page that downloads SpaceEx launches and 
details from the SpaceX GraphQL API. The
 update of launch details when selecting a different
 launch in the list on the left does not work (I stopped there).


I followed this tutorial

https://blog.logrocket.com/build-a-graphql-react-app-with-typescript/

but used the updated SpaceX URL 

https://api.spacex.land/graphql/

To start:
```yarn start```
